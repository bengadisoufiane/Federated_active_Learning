# Federated Active Learning
Federated active learning is a machine learning approach that enables multiple devices or nodes to collaboratively train a machine learning model while preserving the privacy of the data on each device. This is achieved by training a global model on a small, randomly selected subset of the data from each device, and iteratively refining the model based on the most informative data points.

Federated active learning is particularly useful in scenarios where the data is distributed across multiple devices and cannot be easily centralized, such as in a network of internet-of-things (IoT) devices or in a decentralized organization.

## How does it work?
In federated active learning, the goal is to train a machine learning model on a large, decentralized dataset without compromising the privacy of the data on each device. To do this, a small subset of the data from each device is randomly selected and used to train a global model. This global model is then sent back to each device, where it is fine-tuned on the most informative data points. The process is then repeated until the model reaches satisfactory accuracy.

The most informative data points are identified using an active learning approach, in which the model is used to make predictions on the local data and the data points that the model is most uncertain about are selected for further training. This helps to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted between devices and speeds up the training process.

## Advantages of federated active learning
Preserves privacy: Since the data remains on the device and is only used to train a local model, federated active learning preserves the privacy of the data.
Efficient use of resources: Federated active learning only requires a small subset of the data from each device to be transmitted, making it more efficient in terms of data transfer and storage.
Scalability: Federated active learning can be easily scaled to a large number of devices, making it well-suited for distributed networks such as IoT systems.
## Limitations of federated active learning
Complexity: Federated active learning can be complex to implement and requires coordination between devices.
Convergence: The global model may not converge as quickly as a model trained on a centralized dataset, due to the noise introduced by training on multiple devices.
## Example use case
Federated active learning could be used in a network of IoT devices that are collecting data on environmental conditions. The devices could use federated active learning to train a machine learning model to predict weather patterns while preserving the privacy of the data on each device.
